# Note Taker Starter Code

# Deployed at:
https://calm-waters-98085.herokuapp.com/

## Description:

* This program is designed to build the server-side apis of a note-taker website and storing the POST requests inside a JSON file.
* This project was completed based on the Node.js, the fs modules, and 3rd-party npm express.js framework, and sucessfully deployed on Heroku.
* I have learned the ways to work at the server-side of javaScript API development using express.js, so that the front-end fetch request be performed using the 'GET', 'DELETE', 'POST' methods.

## Built By:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* npm (express.js)
* npm (uuid)


## How to Install:
* Open Gitbash/terminal, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from the "Note-Taker-Express.js-BE" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, navigate to the root directory of this repo.
* Enter `npm init` into the terminal.
* Enter `npm install express` into the terminal to install the express.js framwork package, and enter `npm install uuid` to install the id generator and you are good to go!


## How to Use:
1. Navigate (`cd`) to the root directory in your terminal. Enter `node server.js`, if the question prompts started to appear, you can proceed.
